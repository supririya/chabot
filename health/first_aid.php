       <br>
     <p>Almost everyone will need to use a first aid kit at some time. Make time to prepare home and travel kits for your family’s 
         safety. First aid kits may be basic or comprehensive. What you need depends on your medical training and your distance from
         professional medical help. Ready-made first aid kits are commercially available from chain stores or outdoor retailers, 
         but it’s easy to make smart, inexpensive first aid kits yourself.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">Make Your Own First Aid Kit</h3>     
     <p>Try to keep your kit small and simple. Stock it with multi-use items. Almost anything that provides good visibility of 
         contents can be used for a household first aid kit.
     </p><ul>
     <li>If your kit will be on the move, a water-resistant, drop-proof container is best. </li>
     <li>Inexpensive nylon bags, personal kits, fanny packs, or makeup cases serve very well.</li>
     <li>You do not need to spend a lot of money on a fancy "medical bag." Use re-sealable sandwich or oven bags to group and 
         compartmentalize items.
     </li>
     <li>Put wound supplies in one bag and medications in another.</li></ul>
 <h3 style="text-align:left">How to Use a First Aid Kit</h3>   
     <p>Make sure you know how to properly use all of the items in your kit, especially the medications. Train others in your family 
        to use the kit. You may be the one who needs first aid.Pack and use barrier items such as latex gloves to protect yourself 
        from the bodily fluids of others. Check the kit twice a year and replace expired drugs. Find out the phone number of your 
        regional poison control center at the American Association of Poison Control Centers Web site and keep the number with your
        kit.
     </p>   
     <h3 style="text-align:left">Where to keep your first aid kit:</h3>   
     <ul>
         <li>The best place to keep your first aid kit is in the kitchen. Most family activities take place here. The bathroom has 
             too much humidity, which shortens the shelf life of items.
         </li>
         <li>The travel kit is for true trips away from home. Keep it in a suitcase, backpack, or dry bag, depending on the activity.</li>
         <li>A first aid kit for everyday use in the car should be just like the home first aid kit. For that matter, you could keep 
             similar kits in your boat (inside a waterproof bag), travel trailer, mobile home, camper, cabin, vacation home, and wherever you 
             spend time.
         </li>
     </ul>
 <h3 style="text-align:left">Must-Have First Aid Kit Essentials</h3>   
     <p>You can buy all items for your first aid kits at a well-stocked drug store. Ask the pharmacist for help in selecting items.</p>

          <h3>Burns</h3>
          <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, 
            chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation.</p>
          <h3>Major Burns(seek immediate care)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Are deep </li>
            <li>Cause the skin to be dry and leathery </li>
            <li>May appear charred or have patches of white, brown or black</li>
            <li>Are larger than 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) in diameter or cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or a major
               joint</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Minor Burns(which doesn't need emergency care)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Superficial redness similar to a sunburn</li>
            <li> Pain</li>
            <li>Blisters</li>
            <li> An area no larger than 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) in diameter</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Treating Major Burns</h3>
          <h4><b>Until emergency help arrives:</b></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Protect the burned person from further harm.</b>If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not
               in contact with the source of the burn. For electrical burns, make sure the power source is off before you approach
                the burned person.
            </li>
            <li><b> Make certain that the person burned is breathing.</b> If needed, begin rescue breathing if you know how.</li> 
            <li><b> Remove jewelry, belts and other restrictive items,</b>especially from around burned areas and the neck. Burned areas
               swell rapidly.</li>
            <li><b> Cover the area of the burn.</b> Use a cool, moist bandage or a clean cloth.</li>
            <li><b> Don't immerse large severe burns in water.</b>Doing so could cause a serious loss of body heat (hypothermia).</li>
            <li><b>Elevate the burned area.</b>Raise the wound above heart level, if possible.</li>
            <li><b>Watch for signs of shock.</b> Signs and symptoms include fainting, pale complexion or breathing in a notably
               shallow fashion.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Treating Minor Burns</h3>
          <h4><b>For Minor Burns:</b></h4>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Cool the burn.</b> Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water or apply a cool, wet compress until the
             pain eases.</li>
          <li><b>Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area.</b> Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area 
            swells.</li>
          <li><b>Don't break blisters.</b>Fluid-filled blisters protect against infection. If a blister breaks, clean the area 
            with water (mild soap is optional). Apply an antibiotic ointment. But if a rash appears, stop using the ointment.</li>
          <li><b>Apply lotion.</b> Once a burn is completely cooled, apply a lotion, such as one that contains aloe vera or a 
            moisturizer. This helps prevent drying and provides relief. </li>
            <li><b>Bandage the burn.</b> Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not fluffy cotton). Wrap it loosely to avoid 
              putting pressure on burned skin. Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces pain and protects blistered skin. </li>
              <li><b>If needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever,</b> such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).
              </li>
            </ul>

             <h3>Severe Bleeding</h3>
             <h4><b>For severe bleeding, take these first-aid steps and reassure the injured person.</b></h4>
             <ul>
             <li><b> Remove any clothing or debris on the wound.</b> Don't remove large or deeply embedded objects. Don't probe the
               wound or attempt to clean it yet. Your first job is to stop the bleeding. Wear disposable protective gloves if available.
             </li>
             <li><b>Stop the bleeding.</b> Place a sterile bandage or clean cloth on the wound. Press the bandage firmly with your
               palm to control bleeding. Apply constant pressure until the bleeding stops. Maintain pressure by binding the wound 
               with a thick bandage or a piece of clean cloth. Don't put direct pressure on an eye injury or embedded object.
             </li>
             <li><b>Secure the bandage with adhesive tape or continue to maintain pressure with your hands.</b> If possible, raise 
              an injured limb above the level of the heart.
            </li>
             <li><b>Help the injured person lie down.</b> If possible, place the person on a rug or blanket to prevent loss of
               body heat. Calmly reassure the injured person.
             </li>
             <li><b>Don't remove the gauze or bandage.</b> If the bleeding seeps through the gauze or other cloth on the wound,
               add another bandage on top of it. And keep pressing firmly on the area.
             </li>
             <li><b>Tourniquets:</b> A tourniquet is effective in controlling life-threatening bleeding from a limb. Apply a 
              tourniquet if you're trained in how to do so. When emergency help arrives, explain how long the tourniquet has 
              been in place.
             </li>
             <li><b>Immobilize the injured body part</b> as much as possible. Leave the bandages in place and get the injured person to an emergency room as soon as possible.
             </li>

        <h3>Heart Attacks</h3>
        <h4>Symptoms:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Chest pain, pressure or tightness, or a squeezing or aching sensation in the center of the chest</li>
          <li>Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or occasionally upper abdomen
          </li>
          <li>Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain
          </li>
          <li>Shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting,Sweating</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes. Some people have mild chest pain, while others have more-severe pain. The discomfort
           is commonly described as a pressure or chest heaviness, although some people have no chest pain or pressure at all. Women tend to have more-vague symptoms, 
           such as nausea or back or jaw pain.
        </p>
        <p>Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs hours or days in advance.</p>
        <h4>What to do if you or someone else may be having a heart attack</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Call 108 or your local emergency number.</li>
          <li>Chew and swallow an aspirin</li>
          <li>Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed</li>
          <li>Begin CPR if the person is unconscious.</li>
          <li>If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is immediately available and the person is unconscious, follow the device instructions for using it.</li>

        <h3>CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h3>
        <p>It is an emergency lifesaving procedure. It is a combination of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chest compressions that keeps patient's blood circulating.</li>
          <li>Rescue breathing that provides oxygen to patient's lungs.Chest compressions:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chest Compressions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Place the heel of one hand on the lower half of the person’s breastbone</li>
          <li>Place the other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers.</li>
          <li>Press down firmly and smoothly (compressing to 1/3 of chest depth) 30 times.</li>
          <li>Administer 2 breaths as described below in mouth-to-mouth,</li>
          <li>The ratio of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 breaths is the same, whether CPR is being performed alone or with the assistance of a second 
            person.</li>
          <li>Aim for a compression rate of 100 per minute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mouth-to-mouth Respiration:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> If the patient is not breathing normally, make sure he is lying on his back on a firm surface</li>
          <li>Open the airway by tilting the head back and lifting his chin.</li>
          <li>Close his nostrils with your finger and thumb.</li>
          <li>Put your mouth over the patient’s mouth and blow into his mouth.</li>
          <li>Give 2 full breaths to the patient (this is called ‘rescue breathing’). Make sure there is no air leak and the chest is rising and falling. If his chest
             does not rise and fall, check that you’re pinching his nostrils tightly and sealing your mouth to his. If still no breathing, check airway again for any
              obstruction.</li>       
          <li>Continue CPR, repeating the cycle of 30 compressions then 2 breaths until professional help arrives. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CPR for children aged 1-8 years:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Use the heel of one hand only for compressions, compressing to one third of chest depth.</li>
        <li>Follow the basic steps for performing CPR described above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CPR for infant (up to 12 months of age):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Place the infant on his back. Do not tilt his head back or lift his chin (this is not necessary as their heads are still large in comparison to their 
            bodies).</li>
          <li>Perform mouth-to-mouth by covering the infant’s nose and mouth with your mouth – remember to use only a small breath.</li>
          <li>Do chest compressions, using two fingers of one hand, to about one third of chest depth.</li>
          <li>
            Follow the basic steps for performing CPR described above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to stop CPR?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The patient&#39;s revives and starts breathing on its own</li>
          <li>
            When medical help arrives</li>
          <li>
            When the person giving CPR is exhausted</li>

            One should not panic and should&nbsp; make the patient sit in upright position with his head slightly forward.</li>
          <li>
            With thumb and index finger, one should&nbsp; apply pressure on soft part of nostrils below the nose bridge.</li>
          <li>
            Continue applying pressure until the bleeding stops.</li>
          <li>
            Ask the patient to breathe through the mouth while nostrils are pinched</li>
          <li>
            Loosen the tight clothing around the neck</li>
          <li>
            After 10 minutes, release the pressure on the nostrils and check to see if the bleeding has stopped</li>

         <h3>Snake Bites</h3>
        <p>
          Snake bite is prevalent in our community for generations, and we are not able to prevent it. Education of the common man is required from snake bite,
           as well as measures to be taken after the bite. Snake bite may occur at any time during lifetime. WHO (2004) provided recommendations to reduce death due 
           to snake bite as per international norms. A primary recommendation, based on evidence based procedures, was to establish a single protocol for both first-aid
            and treatment, and is relevant in Indian context as well.</p>
        <p>
          Remember, traditional therapy have no proven benefit in the treatment of snake bite. Do not waste time and send the patient to hospital at the earliest.</p>
        <p>
          <h3>First- Aid treatment protocol:</h3></p>
        <p>
          First-aid currently recommended may be remembered by mnemonic CARRY NO R.I.G.H.T.</p>
        <p>
          CARRY: Do not let victim to walk even for short distance.Transport by conveyance, especially when bite is in legs.</p>
        <p>
          <h3>NO:</h3></p>
        <p>
          NO- Tourniquet.</p>
        <p>
          NO- Cutting.</p>
        <p>
          NO- Electrotherapy.</p>
        <p>
          NO- Pressure immobilisation, nitric oxide donor (nitrogesic ointment/nitrate spray)</p>
        <p>
          <strong>R.I.G.H.T:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>R:</strong> Reassure patient, since 70% of all snake bites are from non-venomous species.Only 50% of bites by venomous type of snakes actually envenomate (poison with venom) victims.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>I:</strong> Immobilise limb in a fashion similar to a fractured limb, in case of bites on the limb. A bandage or cloth is used to hold the splints. Do not apply pressure and ensure that blood supply is not blocked. Compression in the form of tight ligatures does not work and may be dangerous even.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>GH:</strong> Get to Hospital immediately.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>T:</strong> Tell any systemic symptoms that manifest on way to hospital.</p>
        <p>
          Do not waste time in first aid management by traditional methods which may dangerously delay effective treatment.</p>

         </div>
         <h3>Electric Shocks</h3>
         <p>The danger from an electrical shock depends on the type of current, how high the voltage is, how the current traveled through the body, the person's 
           overall health and how quickly the person is treated.
        </p>
         <p>An electrical shock may cause burns, or it may leave no visible mark on the skin. In either case, an electrical current passing through the body can 
           cause internal damage, cardiac arrest or other injury. Under certain circumstances, even a small amount of electricity can be fatal.
        </p>
        <h3>Take these actions immediately :</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Turn off the source of electricity, if possible. If not, move the source away from you and the person, using a dry, nonconducting object made of 
          cardboard, plastic or wood.
        </li>
        <li>Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.
        </li>
        <li>Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled.
        </li>
        <li>Apply a bandage. Cover any burned areas with a sterile gauze bandage, if available, or a clean cloth. Don't use a blanket or towel, because loose fibers can stick to the burns. 
        </li>
       </ul>
       <h3> When to seek emergency care</h3>
       <p> Call 911 or your local emergency number if the injured person experiences:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Severe burns</li>
         <li>Confusion</li>
         <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
         <li>Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)</li>
         <li>Cardiac arrest</li>
         <li>Muscle pain and contractions</li>
         <li>Seizures</li>
